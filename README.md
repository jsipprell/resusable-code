resusable-code
==============

This is a compilation of various recipies and patterns, mostly in python because that's what I happen to use most, which
I have assembled in one place.

The various modules, packages and the like are not intended to interopate in any clean way at all -- merely to be of
potential reuse *somewhere*.
